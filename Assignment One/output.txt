One day I was walking to school when I found a wallet
on the ground. I picked it up. It had no ID in it, so
I decided to keep it. It had One Million bucks in it.
Like any kid, I was exhilarated.

The first thing I did was go to the police to check if
anybody lost it. The man said he would keep it just in case.

I was, of course, upset. Then after a few days of
being sad, I got a call from the person who lost the
wallet. He said he was really grateful with me for being
honest. He was so grateful that he sent my family and me
on a trip to Lichtenstein.

It was the most best
