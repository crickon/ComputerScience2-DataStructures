One day I was walking to school when I found a wallet
on the ground. I picked it up. It had no ID in it, so
I decided to keep it. It had <large number> bucks in it.
Like any kid, I was <adjective>.

The first thing I did was go to the police to check if
anybody lost it. The man said he would keep it just in case.

I was, of course, <feeling>. Then after a few days of
being <mood>, I got a call from the person who lost the
wallet. He said he was really <feeling> with me for being
honest. He was so grateful that he sent my family and me
on a trip to <foreign country>.

It was the most <adjective> day of my life!
